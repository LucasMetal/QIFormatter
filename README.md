Welcome to QIFormatter!
---

A simple visual tool for generating QIF files by pasting text representing transactions.

#### Download & Installation

For now the only way is to clone the repo and compile it, sorry :(  
You'll need Visual Studio 2012.

We could add a compiled version if we see fit.

#### Usage

Just paste the info and press GENERATE!

### Bugs, contact & contributions

Just file an issue on GitHub or send a PR!!

### License

Read `LICENSE` 

Note: I'm using a modified version of [Shane Walter's excellent Qif Library](https://github.com/shanewalters/qif), (Externals directory) hopefully I will be able to merge my changes there.
